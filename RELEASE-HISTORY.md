Legacy v1 inspection remains compatible. Current macOS native reopen/decode revalidated; native Windows, fixed-host and full V1 remain open.

### Previous README status checkpoints

Unpublished task-entry candidate: trusted v2 tasks select and verify the original Python before any current-Python preparation. Actual macOS isolated3.13.15/native0.3.1 resume, project reopen and12-frame decode pass with an empty current cache, bad archive and corrupt current Python lock. Missing/tampered evidence rejects without repair. Source48/plugin50 snapshots are unchanged; nativeWindows entry and full9.29 remain open. [Evidence](docs/evidence/task-bound-entry-candidate-20261009.json).

Development source dev.48 / plugin dev.50 includes installation-receipt protection and bounded macOS isolated Python/native upgrade evidence: 490 regressions (452 passes / 38 conditional skips), plus 19 local PowerShell function cases. Native Windows and fixed-host acceptance remain open. A new-Python bootstrap failure still blocks old-task recovery (OpenSpec 9.29); 75 tasks and full V1 remain open. [Evidence](docs/evidence/isolated-python-upgrade-candidate-20261009.json).

Previous native-upgrade component validates installation receipts and actual macOS active-task isolation across official0.3.1→0.4.0;486 regressions (448 passes/38 conditional skips). Old tasks retain their original controller and external Python3.13.5 executable; new tasks use isolated Python3.13.16 and native0.4.0. External Python is not isolated-stdlib proof. Fixed source47/plugin49 excludes this installer increment; cleanup across state roots, other targets/hosts and fullV1 remain open. [Evidence](docs/evidence/runtime-upgrade-component-candidate-20261009.json).

Working-tree source execution-binding candidate passes24 targeted tests and482 regressions (444 passes/38 conditional skips), plus bounded actual macOS old-task recovery. Task9.25 is checked;9.1.4 and74 implementation tasks remain open. Development source47/plugin49 includes this component; fixed installed-host acceptance remains open. [Evidence](docs/evidence/task-execution-binding-candidate-20261009.json).

Development source45 completes readonly doctor/catalog task9.2.1: explicit verified native discovery, executable recovery argv and offline differences.420 regression passes/38 conditional skips;15 readonly single-skill probes and15 no-Python diagnostics pass. Development source47/plugin49 includes this increment;74 implementation tasks and full V1 remain open. [Evidence](docs/evidence/doctor-capabilities-candidate-20261008.json).

> **Development release dev.50 (2026-10-09):** source dev.48 adds strict Python and CLI installation-receipt checks. Bounded native upgrade evidence is recorded; complete V1 and other platform/host qualification remain open.


Four-domain RT-001 runtime source/integrity acceptance now covers every current scenario; existing pinned skill bytes remain unchanged. Runtime upgrades and fullV1 remain open. [Acceptance architecture](docs/Craft-Fixed-Runtime-Integrity-Architecture.md).

## Development release dev.47 — 2026-10-08

Pins source dev.45, correcting the Windows short/long-path test identity assertion. All 15 skill snapshots retain dev.46 content; source test correction is verified separately. Full V1 remains open.


## Development release dev.46 — 2026-10-08

Pins source dev.44: readonly doctor, executable recovery arguments and offline command/schema differences in all 15 independent skills. Runtime-binding drafts excluded; 74 tasks and full V1 remain open.

Bounded macOS native evidence and 213 source passes / 38 skips; complete V1 and other target platforms/hosts remain open. [Evidence](docs/evidence/managed-orphan-retry-component-20261008.json).

These records were moved verbatim from the README preface. They describe their own versions and are not the current installation contract.

Fixed EffectCraft plugin dev.32/source dev.30 passes independent cold installation for every domain skill,7 installed guard tests and1 actual cold native create/reopen/revise/export case. Across the three updated domains:41 distinct empty caches,21 guards and3 native cases pass; all64 installed skill hashes remain unchanged. Art bundle upgrade and full V1 remain separate. [Evidence](docs/evidence/craft-three-domain-output-guards-fixed-first-use-20261007.json).

EffectCraft source dev.30 candidate protects public workflow output before native sessions:7 guard tests, 120 source regressions (32 explicit-environment skips), and1 actual cold native create/revise/reopen/export test pass. Completed records bind effective plans, source revisions and runtime SHA. Fixed plugin installation and Art bundle integration remain separate gates. [Evidence](docs/evidence/effectcraft-output-execution-candidate-20261007.json) · [Architecture](docs/EffectCraft-Output-Execution-Architecture.md).

Domain scene acceptance now has **43 passed native tests / all 42 distinct domain scene skills**. The fixed-installed tracking case passed with supported H.264 High; the earlier lossless input is unsupported by the native decoder and its failed evidence remains historical. Art role-specific tasks, generic Skills CLI and complete V1 remain open. [Evidence / 证据](docs/evidence/craft-fixed-tracking-supported-input-20261007.json).

Additional scene acceptance: **42 native tests passed / 41 of 42 domain scene skills**. Multicam, timed transcript import, filters and Puppet passed.

Art role-specific tasks, automatic ASR, generic Skills CLI installation and complete V1 remain open. [Evidence](docs/evidence/craft-fixed-additional-task-scenes-20261007.json).

Installed task-scene first use: **38 native tests / 37 distinct domain scene skills pass** from independent cold runtime directories. Five domain scene skills (Film multicam/transcript, Photo filters, Effect puppet/tracking) remain outside this business gate; Art role-specific tasks and generic Skills CLI are separately open. All64 installed hashes remain unchanged. [Evidence](docs/evidence/craft-fixed-installed-task-scenes-first-use-20261007.json).

Current fixed V1 representative native baseline: four installed domain workflows pass with fresh public runtime caches, editable native projects, native reopen, targeted revision and export checks. Film subtitles/voice sync and relocation, Effect text animation preservation, Photo layers/masks/PSD/size variant, and Vector boolean/artboards/SVG-PDF-PNG/recolor all pass. All64 installed hashes stay unchanged. This is four representative tasks, not full V1 or every scene. [Evidence](docs/evidence/craft-fixed-v1-representative-native-baseline-20261007.json).

Every-skill cold first use: **64/64 passed** on macOS arm64 / Python3.13.5 (620.155s). Each single skill used its own empty runtime and default public downloads; locked native version and command discovery passed, installed hashes unchanged. Generic Skills CLI installation and complete V1 remain open. [Evidence](docs/evidence/craft-fixed64-every-skill-cold-first-use-20261007.json).
